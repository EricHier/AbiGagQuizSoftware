# Abi Gag Quiz Software
Python desktop software as a counterpart to the associated Android app.

With this software you can take local quiz shows without needing an internet connection. For this you need a pc with this software which is in the same LAN as the associated cell phones with the android app so that they can communicate via UDP packets.

The questions and answer options are implemented by the image files in the folders. You can clone the repo like this and try it out with the attached set of questions.

This software was developed for the graduation ceremony and has not been used since. If you are interested in this project, please feel free to contact me.
